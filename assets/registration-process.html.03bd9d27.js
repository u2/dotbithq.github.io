Its core value lies in its uniqueness, and understanding the uniqueness of .bit accounts is key to understanding the registration process of .bit accounts. Therefore, we provide a brief overview of the registration process below, as shown in the following figure:</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=".bit Registration Process"></p><ol><li>First, the user applies for registration, during which the account name is hashed and kept confidential.

Why can&#39;t it be purchased once and used forever?</h3><p>Buying once and using forever is not a reasonable economic model. Problems with this model include:</p><ol><li>When high-quality accounts are purchased, the .bit system will no longer generate revenue once they are depleted, and the existing development team will lack the motivation to continuously improve the system, nor will they be able to attract new developers to maintain .bit. However, as infrastructure, continuous improvement and promotion of .bit will be inevitable. Therefore, while a one-time purchase of permanent use may seem attractive, what users actually purchase is an account that will not be maintained in the future.</li><li>The permanent locking of a .bit account due to loss of the private key is a waste for a limited public resource like a .bit account.</li></ol><p>In fact, you can also renew your .bit account for decades at a time to achieve &quot;permanent use&quot;.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-storage-deposit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-storage-deposit" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is the storage deposit?</h3><p>The data of each .bit account is stored on the blockchain, and storing data requires storage space, which requires staked tokens to use.

What is the principle of anti-registration snatching?</h3><p>On the blockchain, all user operations are open and transparent. Therefore, when a user wants to register a .bit account and the corresponding transaction has not yet been packaged into a block in the memory pool, others can see what account the user wants to register. Others can immediately send a transaction with a higher network fee to attempt to get the miner to prioritize packaging this transaction in order to snatch the account. Then they can sell the account to someone who really wants to register it at a high price.</p><p>Anti-registration snatching aims to prevent the above behavior as much as possible.</p><p>The .bit contract requires two steps to register a new account, corresponding to two transactions, in order to perfectly prevent the above snatching behavior.</p><ol><li><strong>Confidential initiation of registration application</strong>: Hash the account to be registered with the registrant&#39;s public key, send the first transaction, and place this Hash on the blockchain.</li><li><strong>Public account name on the chain</strong>: Actually initiate the registration request, publicly disclose the account name to be registered, and carry the Hash from the previous step. At the same time, the contract requires that the Hash reach a mature state, that is, the previous transaction has been packaged into a block and has reached a certain number of confirmations.</li></ol><p>The two transactions require a certain interval, and the second transaction needs to introduce the Cell created by the first transaction. In addition, the user will only publicly disclose the plaintext of the account they want to register in the second step. When a malicious keeper or miner sees the plaintext, it is actually too late. They must start from the first transaction, and by the time they are ready, other keepers have already helped the user complete the registration.</p><h3 id="why-does-the-interface-show-that-the-registration-step-has-been-completed-but-it-was-still-snatched-by-someone-else" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-the-interface-show-that-the-registration-step-has-been-completed-but-it-was-still-snatched-by-someone-else" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does the interface show that the registration step has been completed, but it was still snatched by someone else?</h3><p>The only possibility for this situation is that someone else and you happened to want to register this account and both registered at roughly the same time. Anti-registration snatching can only prevent malicious snatching after others obtain the account you want to register by observing the blockchain. However, it cannot prevent all parties from spontaneously registering a certain account at the same time.</p><h3 id="will-the-fees-paid-for-a-failed-registration-be-refunded" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#will-the-fees-paid-for-a-failed-registration-be-refunded" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Will the fees paid for a failed registration be refunded?</h3><p>Yes, they will be refunded.
